### üß™ Test Feedback

- Under heavy acceleration, attempting to turn the vehicle causes **uncontrollable sliding**.
- The car behaves as if it's drifting unintentionally‚Äîlosing grip and being difficult to stop.
- This is likely due to **lack of forward friction or slip curve tuning** in the WheelCollider's `forwardFriction` and `sidewaysFriction`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This issue is common in basic WheelCollider setups and may require tuning friction curves or applying a traction helper.
