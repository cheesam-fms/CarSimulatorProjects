## ðŸ”§ Toyful Games â€“ Custom Car Physics Demo (Very Very Valet)

A demonstration of fully **custom car physics in Unity** inspired by the game *Very Very Valet*. This tutorial showcases how to build a simple yet responsive vehicle controller without using `WheelColliders`â€”perfect for stylized or arcade-style gameplay.

### âœ¨ Features
- **Rigidbody + Raycast Setup** â€“ Uses only a Rigidbody and four raycast-based suspension points
- **Custom Suspension** â€“ Spring force implementation to simulate realistic bounce and weight support
- **Custom Steering** â€“ Calculates tire direction and applies lateral friction to prevent side slipping
- **Acceleration & Braking** â€“ Force-based driving with acceleration curves to simulate torque falloff at high speed
- **No WheelColliders** â€“ Fully custom, lightweight approach for better control and stylization

> While no full code is provided, the video clearly explains the fundamentals of building a custom car physics system from the ground up.
