# ðŸš— CarSimulatorProjects

This is a curated collection of car simulation-related Unity plugins, systems, and third-party tools. Some have been personally tested, while others are archived for future experimentation. This serves as a central hub for learning, prototyping, and researching realistic vehicle simulation and driving experiences in Unity.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Inside

This collection includes:
- **Vehicle Physics Systems** â€“ Advanced physics engines for realistic car handling
- ðŸŽ® Input & Control Integration â€“ Gamepad, steering wheel, and mobile input support
- ðŸ”§ UI & HUD Components â€“ Speedometers, minimaps, and car dashboards
- ðŸ§© CarSim Tools & Plugins â€“ Essential Unity assets for car simulation development

## ðŸ§ª Purpose

This repository is intended for:
- Archiving useful car simulation tools and plugins
- Documenting tested vs untested assets
- Exploring workflows and systems for building realistic or arcade-style driving games in Unity
